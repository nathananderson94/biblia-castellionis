# Text Files

This directory contains the plain text files in their various stages of processing.

* [/OCR](https://github.com/nathananderson94/biblia-castellionis/tree/main/TXT/1%20-%20OCR) contains the raw OCR output from Google Books (very low quality, but it does speed up the process somewhat.)
* [/Post-Corrected](https://github.com/nathananderson94/biblia-castellionis/tree/main/TXT/2%20-%20Post-Corrected) contains the corrected version of the OCR files.
* [/Edited](https://github.com/nathananderson94/biblia-castellionis/tree/main/TXT/3%20-%20Edited) contains the files with additional updates to spelling and formatting.
* [/Macronized](https://github.com/nathananderson94/biblia-castellionis/tree/main/TXT/4%20-%20Macronized) is the final product in txt format, including macrons to differentiate long and short vowels.

There is currently a backlog of files (the entire Book of Genesis, part of Exodus, and the 4 Gospels) which unfortunately are lacking some of these intermediate files. Future transcriptions, however, will be better documented according to this step-by-step process.
